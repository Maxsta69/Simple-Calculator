# Simple Calculator in Python
This is a simple calculator implemented in Python, providing basic arithmetic operations. The calculator includes four core methods:
 - 'add(x, y)' - Returns the sum of 'x' and 'y'
 - 'subtract(x, y)' - Returns the difference between 'x' and 'y'
 - 'multiply(x, y)' - Returns the product of 'x' and 'y'
 - 'division(x, y)' - Returns the quotient of 'x' divided by 'b', with error handing for division by zero.

Features:
 - Addition: Adds two numbers together.
 - Subtraction: Subtracts the second number from the first.
 - Multiplication: Multiplies two numbers.
 - Division: Divides the first number by the second. Includes error handling for division by zero.
 - User Interaction: The program prompts the user to choose an operation, input numbers, and decide whether to perform another calculation.

How to Use:
 1. Clone the repository or download the script.
 2. Run the Python script in your terminal or any Python IDE.
 3. Follow the on-screen instructions to select an operation and input numbers.
 4. The result of the chosen operation will be displayed, and you will be prompted to perform another calculation or exit.

Error Handling:
 - The program handles invalid input (non-numeric values) by prompting the user to re-enter valid numbers.
 - The 'division()' method includes a check for division by zero and returns an error message if attempted.

Requirements:
 - Python 3.x
